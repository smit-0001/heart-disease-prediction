# Heart Disease Prediction

Tech Stack: Data Analysis, ML, Python, Visualization
Summary: In this project we try to predict if a patient has chances of heart disease based on the values of different health related parameters like blood pressure, cholestrol, etc.

# Heart Disease Prediction

Part 1 - Knowing the Dataset

Part 2 - Data Visualization

# Part 3 - ML Model Training and Testing

We keep 20% of data for test.

### We train 5 ML models namely →

- 'Logistic Regression',
- 'Naive Bayes',
- 'Random Forest',
- 'Extreme Gradient Boost',
- 'K-Nearest Neighbour',
- 'Decision Tree',
- 'Support Vector Machine'

### The Accuracy of the models is →
